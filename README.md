# Zomboid_Mod_Checker
Checks if any of mods for a dedicated zomboid server have updated, and if so restarts the server to pull the latest version. Wrote for, and tested on, Windows. It could support both Linux and Windows with some basic changes.


To my knowledge it doesn't work but only because this script is not able to retart itself. I just lost interest in the project. I recommend https://github.com/quarantin/pz-server-tools as its way way better. It only works for Linux though.
